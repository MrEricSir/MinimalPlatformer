# MinimalPlatformer
Doesn't get much simpler than this!

MinmalPlatformer is a game <sup>[citation needed]</sup> written in [QtQuick](https://www.qt.io/qt-quick/). It's controlled with the arrow keys and the spacebar.  You have to compile it yourself because I'm kinda lazy.

Play as a white rectangle against a sea of blackness. Or use your imagination and pretend you're a fridge, or an Italian plumber, or whatever.  Who cares.

The game starts out like this:

You can move right:

Or even to the left:

You can even jump:

But that's it, really. Expecting more? Tough.
